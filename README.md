# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Dosbol Aliev**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Debug-a-thon Toolkit** is an Android app that was initially riddled with several Kotlin bugs across multiple activities. After debugging, the app now functions as a collection of simple interactive widgets—ranging from a greeting screen to dynamic color changes and number operations. The project helped reinforce Kotlin syntax, Android activity navigation, and debugging practices.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🐛🛠️✅
